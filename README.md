# genesis-explained
Code examples from the Genesis Explained book.

This project can be added as a plugin to allow you to modify and test the code. It can also be used as a resource to copy the code examples from the [Genesis Explained](https://www.amazon.com/Genesis-Explained-Step-Step-Guide-ebook/dp/B079G81J3W/) book.

Code is arranged into folders by chapter name. If the code was assembled in parts, then only the final part will be present. There is a comment above the code examples that lines up with the sections in the chapter.

Simple code samples used as illustrations only are included in the `auxiliary.php` file. Any functional code examples are included in the `example.php` file.

Finally, any code found in Genesis core is not included.
